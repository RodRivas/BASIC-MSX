MyPONG - MSX_BASIC

I did this as an exercise of BASIC.
Written to run in a MSX1 or higher. 
Player 1 use keyboard (up and down arrow keys) / Player 2 use joystick

If you intend to study the code I recommend that you use the version 1 code (PONG.BAS).

Version 2 and 3 are optimized versions (with less spaces and lines).
Version 3 is identical to version 2 but is configured for 1 player. sing only the 4 directional arrows.

Below links to play online:

If you want to adjust the number of turns (by default it is 7 points), change the line 740.  Put the value of C and D.

 PT-BR: 
Para modificar o total de pontos que define quem é o ganhador (está definido para o total de 7) altere o valor das variáveis C e D na linha 740.
